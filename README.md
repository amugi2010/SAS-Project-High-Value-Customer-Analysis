## Project Overview
In conducting this exercise, I seek to understand the information requirements needed for this analysis. Central to this theme are four key areas I would like to highlight as critical to this exercise.

#### Quality of data 
Creating an analytical file involves preparing the data in a form that is conducive for analysis. This will involve the transformation of raw data into usable features. Poor data quality leads to biased or inaccurate predictions.

#### Data integration 
Most often data used in analytics comes from multiple sources, I will be merging data from two sources (Customer & Transaction file) to create an analytical file. This is to ensure all relevant information is considered during the analysis.

#### Feature selection 
This exercise will also involve the creation of variables that will be relevant to my analysis. By carefully selecting features I hope to improve the accuracy and robustness of my prediction.

#### Model training and evaluation
The creation of an analytical file serves as an input to predictive models. Ensuring a well-structured analytical file will simplify the process of evaluating my model and help in assessing the performance of my predictive models.        


## Data Source

Customer Data: The primary datasets used for this analysis is the "custfile.csv" file, which contains customer demographics and
Transaction Data: "transfile.csv" file which contains each customer transactions over a period of time.


## Tools

- SAS Studio - for data cleaning, analysis and visualisation.
- Microsoft Power Point - for presentation.


## Data Cleaning and Preparation

In preparing my data for analysis I performed the following tasks:
1. Importing of data into SAS Studio.
2. Performing random sample on data.
3. Performing frequency distributions.
4. Cleaning, formatting & standardizing data.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

Performed EDAs to explore the customer data to get insights such as:
- Customer purchasing power
- Customer preferred payment type
- Customer household size and
- Relationships between key variables.


## Creation of the Analytical File

In creating the analytical file I created new variables in the transaction file and aggregated amount to total amount at the customer level.
I conducted joins between customer file and transaction file and created an analytical file at the customer level.


## Data Analysis
As part of my analysis I created new variables from the analytical file and performed some basic statistics to gain insights from the 
analytical file. I plottd some graphs against the key variables as well as used a proc summary to determine relationships and gain
more insights from the analytical file.

## Key Findings
Compared to females, males tend to have:
- High-income levels 
- Low credit score
- High education level
- Much younger and
- Low tenure

Compared to other regions, customers living in ‘N’(Southwest of Ontario) have:
- High-income levels
- Moderately high credit score
- Relatively high level of education
- A sizable household
- And fairly old demographics.

Compared to other payment types, payment type B is mostly preferred by customers who:
- Are older 
- Have been with the company for a while
- Have high levels of education
- Have good credit score 
- Have a slightly high-income level 


## Limitations
I had to retain only information present in the customer file and omitted information that were missing in transaction file to
arrive at my analytical file. These were about 10 records that could possibly impact my findings, but without it there are still
strong indications the derived sights give a better indication of the datasets.
